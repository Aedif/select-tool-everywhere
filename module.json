	"description": "Adds the select tool to  all controls(measure templates, lighting and sound) and a patch for journal notes so the select tool works there too. This is a quick and dirty module, the selection doesn't show correctly but you can move multiple light/sounds/templates/journals with this. This will probably be obsolete in the future.",
